# Scripts Collection Documentation
This repository contains a collection of useful scripts for various tasks and integrations. Below you'll find detailed information about each component and how to use them.

## Installation
Scripts are installed to `/usr/local/lib/scripts` and can be run directly after installation.

```bash
# Pattern
scripts <provider> <action>

# Example
scripts gitlab mr-create <target_branch>
```

The repository includes an installation script (`install.sh`) that:
- Installs the scripts to `/usr/local/lib/scripts`
- Sets up auto-completion for the scripts
- Requires root privileges to install
- Adds necessary bash completion configurations

To install, run:
```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

## Uninstallation
To remove the scripts collection from your system, use the uninstall command:

```bash
sudo scripts system uninstall [--flag]
```

Available flags:
- `--keep-config`: Keeps the autocomplete configuration in your `.bashrc` file

The uninstallation process:
- Removes all scripts from `/usr/local/lib/scripts`
- Removes the scripts command from `/usr/local/bin`
- Removes the autocomplete script from `/etc/bash_completion.d/`
- Removes autocomplete entries from `.bashrc` (unless `--keep-config` is specified)

Some unneccesary commands

## Requirements
- Bash shell environment
- `curl` for API requests
- `jq` for JSON processing

## Environment Variables
The following environment variables are required for different scripts:

- `GITLAB_PRIVATE_TOKEN`: For GitLab operations
- `CU_PERSONAL_TOKEN`: For ClickUp operations

## Auto-completion
