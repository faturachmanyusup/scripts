# Scripts Collection Documentation
This repository contains a collection of useful scripts for various tasks and integrations. Below you'll find detailed information about each component and how to use them.

## Installation
Scripts are installed to `/usr/local/lib/scripts` and can be run directly after installation.

```bash
# Pattern
scripts <provider> <action>

# Examples
scripts gitlab mr-create <target_branch> [-m "MR Title"]
scripts gitlab mr-create -m "MR Title" <target_branch>
```

The repository includes an installation script (`install.sh`) that:
- Installs the scripts to `/usr/local/lib/scripts`
- Sets up auto-completion for the scripts
- Requires root privileges to install
- Adds necessary bash completion configurations

To install, run:
```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

## Uninstallation
To remove the scripts from your system, you can use the uninstall command:

```bash
sudo scripts uninstall [flag]
```

Available flags:
- `-v, --verbose`: Show detailed information about what's being removed

Alternatively, you can run the uninstall script directly:
```bash
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```

## Update
To update the scripts to the latest version, you can use the update command:

```bash
sudo scripts update
```

This will:
- Download the latest version from the repository
- Uninstall the current version
- Install the new version
- Clean up temporary files

The update process does not depend on the local repository state and requires root access.
